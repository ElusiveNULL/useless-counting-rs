# useless-counting-rs
Useless joke program in Rust that runs for an indefinitely long time but will theoretically end eventually.
Initializes the smallest negative 64-bit float and the largest positive one, then continuously adds the smallest possible increment to the negative one while subtracting it from the positive one until each float is the opposite of what it started as.
